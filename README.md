# 📊 Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a project focused on data analysis using Python. It covers essential techniques such as data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The goal of the project is to analyze a dataset, identify key patterns, and generate meaningful visualizations to enhance understanding of the underlying data.

## 📖 Introduction
This project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of data analysis techniques using Python. By following this process, you will gain insights into data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, all crucial steps for working with real-world datasets.

---

## 📦 Importing Libraries
The first step is to import necessary libraries that will assist with data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

---

## 📂 Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using the `pandas` library, which will allow us to manipulate and analyze the data efficiently.

```python
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview
This section provides a preview of the dataset, showcasing the first few rows to understand its structure and the types of data it contains.

```python
data.head()
```

---

## 🛠️ Data Info
This step shows detailed information about the dataset, such as column names, data types, and the number of non-null entries.

```python
data.info()
```

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

### ❌ Eliminating Duplicates
We check for and remove duplicate rows to ensure the dataset's integrity.

```python
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

### 🚨 Checking for Null Values
Identifying and handling missing values ensures we have clean data for analysis.

```python
data.isnull().sum()
```

### 🗑️ Dropping Unnecessary Columns
Unnecessary columns are dropped to reduce complexity and focus on relevant features.

```python
data.drop(['unnecessary_column'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```

---

## 🕰️ Data Transformation: Date and Time Parsing
In this step, we transform date columns into a standardized format to facilitate further analysis.

```python
data['date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date_column'])
```

---

## 📈 Examining Continuous Variables
We analyze continuous variables to understand their distribution and any potential relationships with other features.

```python
data.describe()
```

---

## 📝 Print All Columns
This step prints all column names in the dataset for reference and to assist with feature selection.

```python
print(data.columns)
```

---

## 🎨 Theme Setting
Setting a consistent theme for visualizations to improve readability and presentation.

```python
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")
```

---

## 📊 Data Visualization: Using Plots to Find Relationships Between Features
We use various visualizations (such as scatter plots, box plots, and pair plots) to explore relationships between the features and uncover patterns in the data.

```python
sns.pairplot(data)
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion
By following this data analysis workflow, you will gain a better understanding of the dataset through cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data. The analysis can reveal hidden patterns and relationships that will inform decision-making and help build predictive models.
